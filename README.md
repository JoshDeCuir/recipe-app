<h1>Recipe Application </h1>


This web application is built using Python with the Django framework. It is a fully-featured app that includes an admin panel for performing CRUD operations on the database and allows users to sign up and create their own content. Users can create and modify recipes, specifying ingredients, cooking time, and a difficulty level automatically calculated by the application. Additionally, users can search for recipes by ingredients, making it easy to find dishes that match what they have on hand.
